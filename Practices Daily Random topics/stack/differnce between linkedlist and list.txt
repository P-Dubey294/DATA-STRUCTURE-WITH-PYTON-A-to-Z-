Stack implementation using list..

list is datatype 

// Advantage :- 1> directly Access to the element via index .
                2> efficiently Access to the elemet via index 
                3> simple implementation (directyl supported by any
                proograming languages)

// Disadvantages :- 1> fixed sized 
                    2> if we have resized the list of the element 
                    so ot has been costly 
                    3> insertion and deletions (if we have insert or
                    deleted the element at the end of list so time complexity is 
                    0(1) but we insert or deleted at the middle of list so Time complexity 
                    will be 0(n))
